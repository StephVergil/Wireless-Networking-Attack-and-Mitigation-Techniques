# Wireless Networking Attack and Mitigation Techniques

## Overview

This project explores methods to analyze wireless network traffic, extract data from unencrypted and encrypted transmissions, and evaluate the vulnerabilities of different wireless security protocols like WEP and WPA. Using tools such as Wireshark and Aircrack-ng, this lab demonstrates the risks of weak encryption and highlights techniques to mitigate potential threats.

## Key Features

1. **Plain Text Traffic Analysis**:
   - View unencrypted wireless traffic to identify data vulnerabilities.
   - Extract files, images, and sensitive information (e.g., credentials) from captured packets.

2. **Exploiting and Analyzing WEP Traffic**:
   - Decrypt WEP traffic using Aircrack-ng to recover encryption keys.
   - Analyze decrypted traffic for DNS queries, HTTP objects, and file transfers.

3. **Exploiting and Analyzing WPA Traffic**:
   - Use dictionary attacks to crack WPA passphrases.
   - Decrypt WPA traffic and analyze DNS queries, HTTP objects, and FTP file transfers.

## Lab Steps Overview

### 1. Examining Plain Text Traffic
- **View Wireless Traffic**: Use Wireshark to load `httpcapture.cap` and filter for DNS queries to inspect unencrypted traffic.
- **Extract Files**:
  - Use the "Export Objects" feature in Wireshark to recover HTTP files like images or zip files.
  - Save and open extracted files for further inspection.

### 2. Exploiting WEP Traffic
- **Decrypt Traffic**:
  - Use Aircrack-ng to recover WEP keys:
    ```bash
    aircrack-ng ~/Desktop/captures/WEP.cap
    ```
  - Decrypt traffic with Airdecap-ng:
    ```bash
    airdecap-ng -w <WEP_KEY> ~/Desktop/captures/WEP.cap
    ```
- **Analyze Decrypted Traffic**:
  - Load decrypted traffic in Wireshark and filter for DNS, HTTP, or FTP data.
  - Export and review recovered files such as images and zip archives.

### 3. Exploiting WPA Traffic
- **Crack WPA Passphrases**:
  - Perform a dictionary attack with Aircrack-ng:
    ```bash
    aircrack-ng ~/Desktop/captures/WPA.cap -w /usr/share/john/password.lst
    ```
- **Decrypt Traffic**:
  - Use Airdecap-ng to decrypt WPA traffic:
    ```bash
    airdecap-ng ~/Desktop/captures/WPA.cap -e <SSID> -p <PASSPHRASE>
    ```
- **Analyze Decrypted Traffic**:
  - Inspect decrypted packets in Wireshark and filter for DNS, HTTP, or FTP data.
  - Export and review transferred files.

## Real-World Relevance

This lab simulates realistic wireless networking scenarios to teach key cybersecurity concepts:
1. **Data Privacy**: Demonstrates the importance of encrypting wireless traffic to protect sensitive information.
2. **Protocol Vulnerabilities**: Highlights the weaknesses in outdated encryption protocols like WEP and older WPA implementations.
3. **Incident Response**: Provides hands-on experience in analyzing and responding to compromised network traffic.
